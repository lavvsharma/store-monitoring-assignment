# Loop - Store Monitoring Solution

Loop is a system that monitors several restaurants in the US and provides real-time information about their online status. All restaurants are expected to be online during their business hours. However, sometimes, due to various reasons, a restaurant might temporarily go offline. Restaurant owners want to track and receive reports on the historical occurrence of such incidents. To address this need, we have developed two modules, "store_monitoring" and "store_monitoring_das," that work together to provide a comprehensive solution.

## Problem Statement

The problem we aim to solve is as follows:

- **Issue**: Restaurants occasionally go offline during their business hours.
- **Solution**: Provide restaurant owners with the ability to monitor and generate reports on restaurant online/offline status.

## Modules

### `store_monitoring`

The `store_monitoring` and `store_monitoring_das` module is designed to:

- Monitor the online status of restaurants.
- Collect and store real-time data about restaurant online/offline status.
- Generate reports and historical data for restaurant owners to analyze.
